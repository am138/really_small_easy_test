This is a small test to check what did you learn in the past two days.
 
- make sure you have mocha installed globally
- pass the test files by running the following commands :
 mocha server/movie/spec.js 
 mocha server/book/spec.js 

- make the server running by running :
 npm start

 -the code written in the files may have some errors that you need to fix
 -finish implementing the missing functions and routes in the files

- you are not allowed to use any resources but the documentation
